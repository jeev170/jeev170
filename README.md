## 🚀 About Me
I am a sophomore specializing in **Artificial Intelligence**, with a strong interest in building
**real-world, impact-driven systems** using machine learning, data science, and backend development.

I enjoy working across the full pipeline — from data preprocessing and model building to deployment
and visualization — and I actively contribute to projects, internships, and open-source communities.
